# The LaunchDarkly Client Inspector

This is an Android-native LaunchDarkly utility application whose intent is to allow a quick view of a LaunchDarkly project environment's client flags and their values. Flag values can vary depending on user attributes and so an interface to define user attributes (and change them during an active connection) is also included.

Note that this app is not created nor maintained by LaunchDarkly.
